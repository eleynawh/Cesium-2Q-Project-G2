            <p>A Walk to Remember: On Choosing Better Leaders for Tomorrow

"First you will smile, and then you will cry—don't say you haven't been warned."

Such is the message of Nicholas Sparks’ prologue on the well-beloved “A Walk to Remember.” Such, too, is the echo in every Filipino’s footstep during the Trillion Peso Walk on September 21, 2025, as our countrymen marched to demand change and a better tomorrow.

The choice of our leaders is in our hands. As citizens of a democratic republic, we get to cast votes with hopes that those we put in positions of power can be trusted with both our country’s highs, and its moment of vulnerability, with our sorrows as people of our nation and our triumphs as its pride. This is 
This was the driving force of the 50,000 Filipinos who stood in the streets, protesting, the thousands online showing support from afar, the schools who rose against the cruelty on their own - the people who have long been fooled.
what we do, as Filipinos, and what our leaders are supposed to embody, as harbingers of advancement.

Today, the hands that once dropped hopeful ballots into boxes are raised in fists, demanding accountability and justice, shaming the very leaders we voted for, the leaders we trusted with our nation.

In their haste to put themselves first, and benefit themselves before the people, our leaders have become greedy, and greed has its consequences. When the money is stained with blood of the people you were supposed to protect, what kind of person does it make you if you choose to pocket it anyway?

This sparked outrage among citizens, and rightfully so. Our money, earned through toil and sacrifice, through long hours and countless struggles, ending up in the dainty laps of those who have never known such work is an injustice that cannot stand.

This outrage was the driving force behind the 50,000 Filipinos who took to the streets in protest, the thousands supporting them online, the schools that rose against cruelty on their own — all the people who had long been played for fools. This is our country, and we will take it back from those who seek only to sate their own greed.
This is our country, and we will take it back from those who seek to sate their own thirst.
Some of us who rejoiced in the results of our election are people who cry in outrage today. "First you will smile, and then you will cry—don't say you haven't been warned." But the sun will shine on us again, let its rays touch the destruction the flood brought, and bring to light the flaws of our government.

We choose our government, but we can also choose a better tomorrow—today. That change starts with us. We will always remember September 21, 2025 as a day where we opened our eyes against the injustices. From here on out, it’s a walk to a better tomorrow.
Eyes up and ahead, Philippines.
