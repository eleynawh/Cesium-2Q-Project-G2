                <h2>Taylor Swift</h2>
                <p>Taylor Swift’s The Life of a Showgirl is shaking things up—and not everyone is thrilled. Instead of the heart-wrenching storytelling fans know her for, she’s gone bold, raw, and a little in-your-face, with lyrics and themes that feel more performative than personal. Longtime listeners were especially surprised by the fifth track, “Eldest Daughter,” which breaks the tradition of gut-punch ballads they’d come to expect. Still, despite the mixed reactions, the album is impossible to ignore: all 12 songs landed in the top 12 of the Billboard Hot 100, it debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, and Swift proves once again that even when she divides her fans, she dominates the charts.

                <h2>D4vd</h2>
               <p>D4vd, usually celebrated for turning heartbreak into art, is now caught in a real-life mystery that’s unfolding far from the studio. An unreleased love song called Celeste has become an unexpected backdrop to a case involving a woman found dead in his Tesla, a police search of a Hollywood Hills home tied to him, and a private investigator hinting at strange items discovered on the property. He isn’t considered a suspect, and the cause of death remains undetermined, but he’s already brought in a high-profile defense attorney as the situation grows increasingly surreal. </p>
