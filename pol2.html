                <p>Conservative activist Charlie Kirk was <span>shot</span> while on his "American Comeback" tour on September 10,
                    2025 at Utah Valley University. This event happened when Charlie Kirk showed up for the debate on
                    Wednesday at the UVU campus courtyard area, which is located right outside the Hall of Flags. In
                    there, a tent bearing his <span>"PROVE ME WRONG"</span> branding was present, guarded by two rows of safety
                    barriers. </p>

                <p>The American Comeback tour started. As he was answering someone's question about transgender mass
                    shooters, a loud “pop” interrupted: it was a gunshot. When people heard the gunshot, the place
                    turned into chaos, everybody was running, screaming, and yelling. Reporter Emma pits stated,<span> "his
                    neck kind of turned, and we saw blood immediately.</span></p>

                <p>A few moments later, outside there was a group of bodyguards carrying Kirk out to an SUV then he was
                    moved to a private vehicle and taken to Timpanogos Regional Hospital. After a while US President
                    Donald Trump announced his death writing, "The Great, and even Legendary, Charlie Kirk, is dead.”</p>

                <p>On September 12, 2025, Tyler Robinson, the man accused of shooting right-wing activist Charlie Kirk,
                    was arrested and charged with aggravated murder. According to Robinson's mother, Robinson was
                    becoming more political over the years and had started to lean more to the left becoming more
                    pro-gay and trans-rights.</p>

                <p>Authorities released messages between Robinson and his unnamed roommate which they said was a man
                    transitioning to woman and was in a romantic relationship with the defendant. In the message, the
                    roommate asked, "Why?," in which Robinson responded with "I had enough of his hatred," "some hate
                    can't be negotiated out." Also, according to Attorney Jeff Gray, Robinson also left a note for his
                    roommate, which allegedly said "I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk, and I'm going to
                    take it."</p>

                <p>Katherine Schweit, a former FBI agent and prosecutor, said investigators will be busy tracking
                    Robinson's online records to get more information and "piece them all together to see how someone
                    moves on the pathway from frustration all the way to choosing to commit a violent act." She also
                    said, "TV and movies have taught us that the motive is the most important thing, but from a
                    prosecution standpoint, it's not." She noted that some assassinations were only motivated by the
                    desire to be famous or impress people.</p>
